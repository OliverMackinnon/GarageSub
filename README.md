# The Garagesub Project

Welcome to the Garagesub Project, an open-source initiative to design and build a capable, modular Remotely Operated Vehicle (ROV) for underwater exploration, right from your garage.

## Project Overview

The Garagesub is designed to be a robust and accessible platform for aquatic observation and data collection. Its core philosophy is modularity, allowing builders to customize and upgrade their ROVs with different sensors, cameras, and tools as their needs evolve. The central pressure vessel houses the electronics, while the versatile frame provides mounting points for propulsion and payloads.

### Key Features

* **Modular Frame:** Built with durable aluminum extrusions, the frame is easily modifiable and expandable.
* **High-Thrust Propulsion:** Equipped with four powerful thrusters for precise maneuvering and stability.
* **Depth-Rated Design:** Engineered to operate effectively at significant depths.
* **Integrated Camera:** Features a high-definition camera for real-time video feeds and observation.
* **Open-Source Hardware:** All designs and schematics are freely available to the community.

### Our Mission

We believe underwater exploration should be accessible to everyone. The Garagesub Project aims to empower makers, researchers, and enthusiasts with the tools to explore lakes, rivers, and coastal areas, fostering a deeper understanding of our underwater world.
