# Buoyancy Calculations and Implementation

## How buoyancy works

In order for an ROV to be neutrally buoyant, the weight of the ROV must
equal the weight of the displaced water. Because saltwater is more dense
than water, this means that your ROV will never be neutrally buoyant in
freshwater and saltwater so you must plan for only one.

## How to calculate for neutral buoyancy

There are two methods for making your ROV neutrally buoyant. You can do
it by taking the dry weight and then measuring the volume of your ROV,
or you can do it by finding the submerged weight and then adding
buoyancy on after. The wet weight method is easier but will require
submerging a scale underwater.

## Dry Weight Method:

1.  Measure the weight of your robot on land

2.  Find the volume of your robot based on either accurate CAD models,
    or tested data

    a.  Volume of your robot can be measured by placing robot in a
        container of water filled up completely. The volume will can be
        found my measuring the amount of water that has overflowed from
        the container.

3.  Do calculations to find either excess weight or buoyancy of ROV and
    find what is required to counteract that

4.  Add necessary foam or weight to ROV for neutral buoyancy

## Wet Weight Method:

1.  Submerge your robot in water and measure the weight in water

2.  Based on excess weight, do calculations to find what necessary
    materials need to be added to counteract force

3.  Add necessary foam or weight to ROV for neutral buoyancy

## Creating buoyancy with expanding polyurethane foam

1.  Find your necessary volume of foam.

2.  Create a mold that will be filled with foam

3.  Mix the foam -- fill a container with two part foam and mix
    thoroughly

4.  Pour mixed foam into molds -- The foam will expand around 30 times
    of its liquid volume
