# GarageSub Documentation

Welcome to the documentation hub for the GarageSub project.

To ensure our documentation is easy to navigate and useful for everyone—from first-time builders to experienced developers—we organize our files using the **Diataxis Framework**.

## How this Documentation is Organized

The Diataxis framework splits documentation into four categories based on the user's needs. If you are looking for information or looking to contribute, please select the appropriate folder below:

### 1. 📂 [Tutorials](./Tutorials)
**"I am learning."**
* **Goal:** Learning-oriented.
* **Content:** Lessons that take the reader by the hand through a series of steps to complete a project.
* **Example:** *“ assembling your first GarageSub frame”* or *“Your first pool test.”*

### 2. 📂 [How-To Guides](./How-To-Guides)
**"I am trying to solve a specific problem."**
* **Goal:** Problem-oriented.
* **Content:** Directions that guide the reader through a specific real-world task or problem. These are like recipes.
* **Example:** *“Calculating Buoyancy”*, *“Calibrating the IMU”*, or *“Replacing a thruster.”*

### 3. 📂 [Reference](./References)
**"I need information."**
* **Goal:** Information-oriented.

### 4. 📂 [Explanation](./Explanation)
