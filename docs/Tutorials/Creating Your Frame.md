# Basics of Aluminum Extrusions

Aluminum extrusions are a popular and versatile material known for their
high strength to weight ratio, corrosion resistance, and exceptional
modularity making them a great fit for an underwater robotics project.
The most common type and the type we will be using are called T-slot
extrusions. This describes the T shaped channel along each of its four
sides.

The hardware for these extrusions is designed to work with these T
shaped channels. The most fundamental piece used is called the T-nut
which is a specialized nut that slides into the slot. There are two
types of common T nuts. Slide in T nuts are T nuts that will permanently
stay within your aluminum extrusion. They are slightly stronger and
often easier to use than drop in T nuts. Drop in T nuts are T nuts that
are able to be placed into the extrusion and then rotated. This allows
them to be placed in after the ends of the extrusion are fixed.

Corner brackets are pieces meant to join multiple extrusions together.
These are readily available for purchase in right angles, but in more
specialized designs, they will often have to be custom made.

# Preparing for Construction

1.  Using your design decide how many of each length is needed for your
    design

2.  Cut your extrusions

    a.  Using a pencil mark each place where a cut will happen, as well
        as what the length of that section will be

    b.  Using proper safety equipment for the tool you are using cut
        your extrusions at the places where cuts were marked

3.  Print out your required corner brackets

4.  Bring everything together in one place

Materials required for frame

# Assembling Your Frame

1.  Plan out how you're going to assemble your frame. Some sections may
    require more planning than just putting fittings together. For
    example, the top section of my frame has a 45-degree angle. If all
    joints are tightened before trying to place it on top, it won't be
    able to go on.

> You'll want to use two nuts for each side of the joint.

2.  Place your hardware into your extrusion by sliding it in from the
    side. Make sure you have two T nuts on before your slide your corner
    bracket on.

3.  Once you've slid your corner bracket on your T nut will likely not
    be in the correct position. Move your nut into the center of the
    hole using your Allen key, push it into the center of the hole to
    allow for a bolt to be threaded into it.

4.  Thread in your bolt into your visible T nut on the other side.

5.  Continue steps 2-4 for the rest of the corner joints on your frame
    until all of them have been secured.

# Troubleshooting Issues

- Screws won't go into hole: Printer likely printed hole too small.
  Drill holes with larger drill bit to open them up.

- Extrusion won't go into joint: loosen other connections to allow for
  nearby joints to slide around. This should give the necessary room to
  move it on.

- T nut fell into inside of corner bracket: If it is easy to take off
  the corner bracket remove it and remove the T nut. If this is too
  challenging, using a drop in T nut will allow you to replace the lost
  one and still secure the part.
