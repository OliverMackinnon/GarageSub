# 1. Objective

This document outlines the step-by-step procedure for assembling a
6-inch diameter, fully modular, and serviceable watertight enclosure for
underwater electronics.

# 2. Materials & Components

## A. Structural Components:

- **1x Clear PVC Schedule 40 Pipe (6\" Diameter)** - Provides a strong,
  pressure-resistant main body while allowing for visual inspection of
  internal electronics without disassembly.

- **2x 6\" Schedule 80 PVC Van Stone Flanges** - These create a robust,
  flat sealing surface for a bolted connection, and the spinning ring
  makes bolt alignment easy.

- **1x 3/8\" Thick Cast Acrylic Sheet** - Offers excellent optical
  clarity for the camera viewport and is thick enough to withstand
  pressure and serve as a rigid end plate.

## B. Sealing Components:

- **2x 6\" EPDM Full Face Flange Gaskets** - EPDM rubber provides an
  excellent compressive seal that is durable in water, and the full-face
  design ensures maximum sealing surface area.

- **1x Oatey PVC Primer & Cement Kit** - This two-step system is
  required to create a permanent chemical weld between the PVC pipe and
  flanges, which is far stronger than glue.

- **1x Molykote 111 Silicone Grease/Compound** - Used to lubricate the
  gasket, this grease improves the seal and prevents it from sticking,
  making the enclosure easy to service.

- **1x NPT Cable Gland Kit** - These fittings allow wires to pass
  through the end plate while creating a reliable, strain-relieved
  waterproof seal around the cable jacket.

## C. Hardware:

- **16x Stainless Steel Bolts, 16x Nuts, & 32x Washers** - Stainless
  steel is essential for all hardware to prevent rust and corrosion in
  an underwater environment.

## D. Required Tools:

- Drill or Drill Press

- TCT Hole Saw Kit (for acrylic)

- Step Drill Bit (for acrylic)

- Wrenches for hardware

- Deburring Tool or Utility Knife

- Sandpaper

- Safety Glasses & Gloves

# 3. Assembly Procedure

## Step 1: Prepare the Blank End Plates

A laser cutter is ideal for this process, although if not available the
following can be done:

The two blank end plates are created from the 3/8\" acrylic sheet.

1.  **Cut the Discs:** Using the EPDM gasket as a template, trace two
    circles onto the acrylic sheet. The outer diameter should match the
    gasket perfectly. Cut these discs out using a jigsaw or band saw.
    Sand the edges smooth.

2.  **Drill Bolt Holes:** Place the gasket back on top of an acrylic
    disc. Use the gasket\'s holes as a guide to mark the 8 bolt holes.
    Carefully drill these holes. A drill press or the use of a pilot
    hole is highly recommended for accuracy. Repeat for the second
    acrylic disc.

3.  **Deburr:** Clean all drilled and cut edges on the acrylic with a
    deburring tool followed by sanding around the edges to ensure a flat
    sealing surface.

## Step 2: Prepare Penetrator Plate & Install Cable Glands

This step details how to install the cable glands onto one of the
acrylic plates. Proper sealing here is critical.

1.  **Drill Penetrator Holes:** On one of the acrylic discs (the
    \"Penetrator Plate\"), determine the layout for your cable glands.
    Use the appropriate size Step Drill Bit or TCT Cutter to drill the
    mounting holes for each gland.

2.  **Pass Cable Through Gland:** Take one cable gland and disassemble
    it. Pass your tether or motor cable through the outer sealing cap
    and then through the main threaded body of the gland.

3.  **Tighten Gland onto Cable:** Firmly tighten the outer sealing cap.
    This will compress the internal grommet, creating a primary
    waterproof seal around the cable\'s jacket.

4.  **Grease and Install on Plate:** Apply a thin, even film of
    **Molykote 111 Silicone Grease** to the gland\'s small rubber
    O-ring. Place this O-ring over the gland\'s threads, insert the
    entire gland-and-cable assembly into its hole on the Penetrator
    Plate, and securely tighten the locking nut from the inside.

5.  **Repeat:** Repeat steps 2-4 for all remaining cables.

## Step 3: Assemble the Main Body Tube

This step involves permanently attaching two flanges to the main PVC
tube.

1.  **Safety:** Work in a well-ventilated area. Wear safety glasses and
    gloves.

2.  **Dry Fit:** Ensure the pipe fits snugly into the socket of the Van
    Stone flanges.

3.  **Prime:** Apply a liberal coat of PVC Purple Primer to the outside
    of both ends of the clear PVC pipe and to the inside socket of two
    Van Stone flanges.

4.  **Cement:** While the primer is still wet, apply an even coat of PVC
    Cement over the same surfaces.

5.  **Assemble:** Firmly push one flange onto each end of the tube until
    it bottoms out, giving it a quarter-turn twist to spread the cement.

6.  **HOLD & CURE:** Hold each joint firmly for 60 seconds to prevent
    the fitting from pushing off. **Allow the assembly to cure for a
    minimum of 24 hours before proceeding.**

## Step 4: Final Assembly & Sealing

This process details the mechanical sealing of one end cap. Repeat the
exact same process for the other end.

1.  **Prepare the Sealing Surfaces:** Ensure the faces of the glued-on
    flange and the acrylic plate are perfectly clean and free of debris.

2.  **Apply Silicone Grease:** Apply a thin, even film of **Molykote 111
    Silicone Grease** to both sides of the **EPDM Gasket**. Also apply a
    thin film to the face of the flange and the face of the acrylic
    plate where the gasket will sit. This lubricates the seal and fills
    microscopic imperfections.

3.  **Create the Sandwich:** Assemble the components in the following
    order:

    1.  Glued-on Van Stone Flange (on the pipe)

    2.  Greased EPDM Gasket

    3.  Acrylic End Plate (Viewport or Penetrator)

4.  **Install Hardware:** Insert the 8 stainless steel bolts (with
    washers) through both flanges and the acrylic plate. Add a washer
    and nut to each bolt on the other side.

5.  **Tighten in a Star Pattern:** Hand-tighten all nuts. Then, using a
    wrench, begin tightening the bolts in a star pattern (like changing
    a car tire). This ensures even pressure is applied across the entire
    gasket. Do not overtighten; you want a firm, snug compression.

## Step 5: Final Testing & Service

- **Leak Test:** Before installing any electronics, fully assemble the
  enclosure and submerge it in water for several hours. Place paper
  towels in the enclosure to identify if moisture entered the container
  while submerged. Place a weight on top to keep it submerged. Check
  thoroughly for any signs of water ingress.

- **Service:** To access the electronics, simply unbolt and remove one
  of the flange end caps. The silicone grease will prevent the gasket
  from sticking, allowing for easy disassembly and reassembly. Re-apply
  a light coat of grease before sealing the unit again.
