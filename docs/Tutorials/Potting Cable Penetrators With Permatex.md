# Introduction

Standard cable glands seal against the *outside* of a cable jacket.
However, for DIY ROVs, we often need a more robust seal that prevents
water from traveling up the cable *between* the internal wires (wicking)
if the outer jacket is cut.

We use Permatex Ultra Black (a high-strength RTV silicone) because it is
oil-resistant, incredibly sticky, and flexible enough to handle the
pressure changes of deep dives.

# Required Tools

- Permatex Ultra Black

- Isopropyl Alcohol

- Sandpaper (160 grit)

- Disposable Gloves 

# Preparation

1.  Roughen Surfaces: Around where you will be putting the Permatex, use
    your sand paper to remove the shine off of the wire. This will allow
    the silicone of the Permatex to better grab onto the wire.

2.  Degrease: Wipe everything that the Permatex will touch down with
    isopropyl alcohol. Make sure there is no leftover debris from the
    sanding.

3.  Let all of the alcohol evaporate before continuing.

# Applying The Permatex

1.  Spread the wires apart and apply Permatex as far into the center of
    where the wires ingress into their shielding.

2.  Once the center of the bundle is filled with the Permatex, apply a
    large amount to the surrounding area.

3.  Smooth the Permatex around the cable. Make sure there are no
    potential ingress points. Make sure you cannot see the wires through
    where you applied the Permatex. It should all be covered in black.
    (Make sure you wear gloves this is gross stuff)

4.  Let the Permatex cure. Make sure you don't touch this or move it
    during the curing time. The skin time is around 30 minutes, and the
    full cure time is roughly 24 hours. Movement can cause the silicone
    to separate from the wire leaving a passage for fluid to travel
    through.

# Validation

1.  Gently pull on the wire from side to side. The silicone should move
    around with the wire. If the wire slides in and out of the silicone,
    the bond has failed.

2.  Look at the edges where the black silicone meets the cables. There
    should be no gaps or lifted edges.
