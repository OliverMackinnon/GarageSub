# BlueOS onto Raspberry Pi

To set up your raspberry pi, you will need an SD card, as well as an
external computer to flash your SD card. Specific instructions for
flashing BlueOS onto your SD card can be found here:

Once done, insert your SD card. You can ensure the system is working by
turning your Raspberry Pi on while plugged into the monitor. It should
show a terminal running Blue OS.
